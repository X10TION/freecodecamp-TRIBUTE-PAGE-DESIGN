      <h3>Biography </h3>
        <p id="bio">
          If you’re looking to build a personal brand, writing in the first person can be a great way to connect with your audience. When you write a first-person bio, use “I” statements to make yourself relatable and approachable.

Here's one way to write a first-person bio: “I’m a freelance writer specializing in small business content. I’ve worked with companies in a variety of industries, from home care services to fine leather goods.” By speaking in the first person here, you take a more personable approach to connecting with a client or brand.

While first-person bios are quite common, third-person bios can prove more effective in informal situations. If you’re job searching, applying for grants, or trying to get published, it’s generally best to stick to the third person. This will make you sound more authoritative and objective about who you are and what you can do.

For instance, when you write a third-person bio you may start with “Jasmine Montgomery is a Senior Hiring Manager at L’Oreal based in New York. She recruits across several business units to connect with the brightest talent from around the globe.” By only using your name and pronouns to speak about yourself here, you are letting your title and skill set speak for themselves.

So your decision to write your professional bio in the first or third person depends on whether you’d like to leave a more personable or assertive impression. Overall, both approaches can be effective when you tailor them to your goals and the audience you are writing for. The most important thing is to be clear, concise, and tell your story in a way that connects with your reader.
